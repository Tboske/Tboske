            My first group project I have done. I was one of the two programmers that worked on this Unity project. In Discool I mainly worked on the parallax effect, generation of the buildings, the combo system and some smaller feautures.</br>
            <b>> <a href="https://github.com/Tboske/TribeEngine/tree/rework">TribeEngine</a></b></br>
            This is a custom engine that I wrote myself using SDL2 and opengl. I also have remade Tron arcade in Tribe. </br>

            Here I played around with some networking using boost::asio. Use of UDP and TCP to send packages to other local pc's.</br>
            <b>> <a href="https://github.com/Tboske/Tribe2.0">Tribe2.0</a> WIP</b></br>
            This is/will be the successor to TribeEngine but I work on this in my free time. There were just some things I didn't like from the old version that I wish i could've rewrote. This Engine uses GLFW (instead of SDL2) with opengl. I am aiming to also include Vulkan into this project.
